-- A small request from VMF:
-- I can’t stop you from reuploading my projects elsewhere, but I’d really prefer if you didn’t.  
-- I’ve put a lot of time and effort into creating them and I hope you respect my wishes to keep  
-- this community fair and supportive. That said, you’re welcome to modify my projects further –  
-- just please give me credit if you do!
